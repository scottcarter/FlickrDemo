## Overview
This demo includes the following elements:
* Flickr API integration using Alamofire.
* Realm DB for bookmarks.
* Table and collection view controllers to present recent images posted to Flickr.
* UIKit VC animations from the collection view controller.
* AppDeveloperKit integration for property configuration.

AppDeveloperKit is in private Alpha testing.  While users of this demo will not yet have access to the graphical UI for AppDeveloperKit 
(unless invited) to modify properties, the demo is still fully functional with the latest configuration that is bundled.

## Installation

* After downloading the project, install the pods with "pod install".
* Insert your Flickr API key where indicated in AppDelegate.swift.  If you do not yet have a key, you can register one at [https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/](https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/)
